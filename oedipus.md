## SPECIAL ABILITIES

### Actions
- **Fast Talk** *(1 Intellect point)*
  > When speaking with an intelligent creature who can understand you and isn’t hostile, you convince them to give you some specific in- formation in the next round; perhaps a name, address, or other details. The information you get out of them must be agreed upon by the GM; it should not put the creature or its allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character. *Action.*
- **Access Onboard** *(3 Intellect points)*
  > You attempt to take control of the onboard computer and can access all prior data (where the vehicle has been) as well as optimizing the navigation system, adding +1 to all navigation rolls. Action.
- **Spin Identity** *(2+ Intellect points)*
  > You convince all intelligent creatures who can see, hear, and understand you that you are someone or something other than who you actually are. You don’t impersonate a specific individual known to the victim. Instead, you con- vince the victim that you are someone they do not know belonging to a certain category of people. A disguise isn’t necessary, but a good disguise will almost certainly be an asset to the roll involved. If you attempt to convince more than one creature, the Intellect cost increases by 1 point per additional victim. Fooled creatures remain so for up to an hour, unless your actions or other circum- stances reveal your true identity earlier. *Action.*
- **Grand Deception** *(3 Intellect points)*
  > You convince an intelligent creature (that can understand you and isn’t hostile) of something that is wildly and obviously untrue. *Action.*
- **Suggestion** *(4 Intellect points)*
  > You suggest an action to another creature (level 2 or lower) within immediate range. If the action doesn’t seem completely at odds with the creature’s nature, it follows your sug- gestion for up to a minute. Instead of applying Effort, to decrease the difficulty, you can apply it to increase the maximum level of the target by 1. When the effect ends, the creature remembers following the suggestion, but believes that it chose to do so willingly. Action to initiate.

### Enablers
- **Practiced With Light Weapons**
  > You can use light weapons without penalty. If you wield a medium weapon, increase the difficulty of the attack by one step. If you wield a heavy weapon, increase it by two steps. You also start with one light weapon of your choice. *Enabler.*
- **Dog Sense**
  > You have an uncanny ability to sense when things aren’t right and can snap to an alert state quickly. You are trained in Initiative. If you are already trained, you become specialized. *Enabler.*
- **Ballistic Skin**
  > You have replaced your standard skin plastics with a layer of ballistic weave providing +1 Armor rating. *Enabler.*
- **Driver**
  > You are trained in all tasks related to driving a car, truck, or motorcycle, including mechanical repair tasks. *Enabler.*
- **Driving on the Edge**
  >  You can take a shot with light or medium ranged weapon and attempt driving tasks as a single action. *Enabler.*
- **Unexpected Betrayal**
  > Within a round or two of successfully using Enthrall, Fast Talk, or a similar ability on a target within short range, the difficulty of the first attack you make on that target is decreased by two steps. Once you use Unexpected Betrayal on a target, the difficulty of using your abilities or attempt- ing simple persuasion on that target is permanently increased by two steps. *Enabler.*
- **Stare Them Down**
  > The mental strength you’ve built up racing over the years is significant. You’re trained in Intellect defense tasks. *Enabler.*
- **Making a Call**
  > Because of your mainstream respectability or influence, you can obtain the name or location of a low level connection who may have the resources your group needs. It’s up to you to make the introduction and obtain the services needed (this may require a conversation, money, or even completing a mission for the NPC). This ability can be used once per play session. *Enabler.*
  > **Sharp Eyed**
  > Years of driving have sharpened your sense of direction. You’re trained in all tasks involving perception and navigation. *Enabler.*
- **Grease Monkey**
  > You are specialized in all tasks related to driving a car, truck or motorcycle, including mechanical repair tasks. *Enabler.*
- **Road Reflexes**
  > You add 3 points to your Speed Pool. *Enabler.*
- **Combat armoring**
  > You have installed a layer of flexible VPC armor under your skin for additional protection. +4 to Armor rating, encumbrance as Medium armor.

## INVENTORY
- Large VROOOOOM "diamond"-esque/"gold"-ish necklace
- Boomer Red trackie with giant embroidered scorpion on the back
- Matching red racing gloves
- Cricket bat

## LASTING DAMAGE
- None

## BACKGROUND
- You grew up in extreme poverty, among criminals. You still have some connections with the old neighborhood.
- There’s safety in numbers and you need safety right now, thanks to that worrying stalker you've got.
- Me and Blix bet on Vurtball matches, and they owe you quite a bit of money at this point.

## DESCRIPTION
> Oedipus Jones is an incredibly superficial, incredibly attractive robodogman who looks at life like he judges book covers and DVD cases — by their covers. (He's not as dim as the Cat from Red Dwarf, but his awareness of how rediculously good-looking he is puts him in the same ballpark as the Cat, with a splash of Zoolander.)
> His body style is largely like the Robodogman on page 33, but his dog breed is kuvasz but with a silver metalic sheen to his fur and a slight LED glow to his eyes, which he covers with large, opaque sunglasses. Some light escapes from behind the glasses and it looks COOL that way. He looks smug, happy and knows he's hot shit.
> Oedipus wears the traditional North Gort Boomer tracksuit but got the 'Drive' Ryan Gosling scorpion embroidered on the back, and plastered the front with patches for his favorite things. He wears an oversized golden necklace of the  word 'VROOOM' on it in gold, with diamonds for extra bling. It doesn't look weird or oversized on his frame, but it definately draws attention.
> His hands are always covered in red driving gloves, night and day, asleep or awake. His index fingers are augmented but dont' reveal their purpose, in that they're laser "fingergunz". Pew pew pew.
> Oedipus carries a cricket bat as his main weapon.

- None
