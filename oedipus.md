### Enablers
- Practiced With Light Weapons (S)
  > You can use light weapons without penalty. If you wield a medium weapon, increase the difficulty of the attack by one step. If you wield a heavy weapon, increase it by two steps. You also start with one light weapon of your choice. *Enabler.*
- Dog Sense (D)
  > You have an uncanny ability to sense when things aren’t right and can snap to an alert state quickly. You are trained in Initiative. If you are already trained, you become specialized. *Enabler.*
- Ballistic Skin (R)
  > You have replaced your standard skin plastics with a layer of ballistic weave providing +1 Armor rating. *Enabler.*
- Driver (TG)
  > You are trained in all tasks related to driving a car, truck, or motorcycle, including mechanical repair tasks. *Enabler.*
- Driving on the Edge (TG)
  >  You can take a shot with light or medium ranged weapon and attempt driving tasks as a single action. *Enabler.*

### Actions
- Fast Talk **(1 Intellect point)** (S)
  > When speaking with an intelligent creature who can understand you and isn’t hostile, you convince them to give you some specific in- formation in the next round; perhaps a name, address, or other details. The information you get out of them must be agreed upon by the GM; it should not put the creature or its allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character. *Action.*
- Spin Identity **(2+ Intellect points)** (S)
  > You convince all intelligent creatures who can see, hear, and under- stand you that you are someone or something other than who you actually are. You don’t impersonate a specific individual known to the victim. Instead, you con- vince the victim that you are someone they do not know belonging to a certain category of people. A disguise isn’t necessary, but a good disguise will almost certainly be an asset to the roll involved. If you attempt to convince more than one creature, the Intellect cost increases by 1 point per additional victim. Fooled creatures remain so for up to an hour, unless your actions or other circum- stances reveal your true identity earlier. *Action.*
