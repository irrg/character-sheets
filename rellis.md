## BACKGROUND
> Youâ€™ve always had a way with people, and your special talents have kept you safe and allowed you to "nd and participate in a lot of interesting odd jobs. Woodcarving is your hobby, and you like to collect nice pieces of wood that you can carve into animals, faces, and other mementos. You and Yamal have a long history, and almost always disagree about the best way to handle situations, but theyâ€™re really good at building things, so you just roll with it. Naveed says that they can always hear you over the thunderous noise of their powers. You wonder if they can hear you all the time. Youâ€™re with these people now because a group of thugs was going to rob you, but you talked them out of it, and theyâ€™re the ones who told you about the ruin youâ€™re exploring.
